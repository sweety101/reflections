How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    we can compare both the versions and easily spot the difference .so that we can spot the bug (if there is any) also it save a lot of time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here
    By having entire history of a file , we know what we have done so far and also what are the additional things that we have done and what else we have to do to make it a perfect one as we desired.Totally, it gives a fair idea about the file and also, we can refer back to it, if unfortunately, we have done something wrong in the current file and can correct it .

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    we know when to commit, this means we can avoid too big or too small commits .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when we make a changes that is related to some other files it is better to use saving multiple files in one commit .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It is very useful to find the history and the difference between two commits. It makes us understand what differences that we have done so far.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me really confident. Because I can recheck the files easily and go back to the previous version if I wish.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use that for correcting the bugs in my programs and If I want to restore the previous commits.
